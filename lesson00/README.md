# Setup lesson
The first program/code to get going with c++ on mac os x 10.13.6.

We use 'g++' as our compiler, which was downloaded from xcode command line tools or just xcode. Either or works.

To compile the code: `g++ main.cpp -o main.o` and we'll get an output file called `main.o` which is runable from the terminal.
